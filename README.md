# enterprise-change-impact-intelligence

**Overview**

This project focuses on understanding how large applications behave after changes are made to them. It looks at system performance data, identifies unusual patterns, and checks whether those issues are related to recent changes such as deployments or configuration updates.

The idea is to make it easier to answer three basic questions when something goes wrong:
what happened, when it happened, and what might have caused it.

**Business Problem**

In large enterprise systems, changes happen frequently. Even small updates can sometimes lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior. Finding the exact reason for these problems usually takes time and often happens only after users are affected.

This project tries to reduce that effort by:

- Regularly tracking key system performance metrics
- Identifying unusual behavior using basic statistics and machine learning
- Relating detected issues to recent system changes to understand possible causes

**Technology Stack**

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Statistical Analysis and applied machine learning
- Power BI
- GitHub
